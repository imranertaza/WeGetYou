            <b>Governing Law, Venue and Arbitration:</b> This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of England without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide the application of the law of another jurisdiction. You and Wegatyou agree to submit to the jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in England, in such legal action or proceeding. The application of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods is hereby expressly excluded. Any claim or dispute (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with this Agreement may be resolved in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, by mutual consent. Such arbitration shall be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section and under the rules of such ADR Provider, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with this Agreement. The party demanding arbitration will propose an ADR Provider and the other party shall not unreasonably withhold consent to use such ADR Provider. The ADR Provider and the parties must comply with the following rules:

You acknowledge that any breach of this Agreement by you would cause irreparable injury to Wegatyou for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and, therefore, Wegatyou will be entitled to seek injunctive relief (including specific performance) in any court of competent jurisdiction.
